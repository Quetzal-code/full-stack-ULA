#Constant time O1
# Example :Accessing an element in an array by its index.

def access_element(arr, index):
    return arr[index]

#Linear time O(n)

#Quadratic time


# To analyze code using Big O notation, follow these steps:

# Identify the Input Size: Determine what "n" represents in your code, often related to the size of the input data.

# Identify Loops and Iterations: Look for loops in your code, as they often determine the primary factors affecting time complexity.

# Count Operations Inside Loops: Count the number of operations inside each loop that depend on the input size "n."

# Combine Complexity: If you have nested loops, multiply their complexities to determine the overall time complexity.

# Choose the Dominant Term: In cases of combined complexity, focus on the term with the highest growth rate, as it will dominate the overall time complexity.

# Simplify: Simplify the expression as much as possible by removing constant factors.
